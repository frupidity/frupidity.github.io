    <section class="post-content">
        <p>When I think about the family members Mr. Frupid and I are most similar to, I immediately think of Mr. Frupid&rsquo;s grandparents. They are cheap, stubbornly independent, and indecisive to a fault. Now I realize that I sound like a terrible person for calling out seemingly negative qualities in kind old folks, but I list them with love, because I share all of the same characteristics. These traits tend to drive Mr. Frupid&rsquo;s parents crazy as they&rsquo;re trying to help the grandparents maneuver through old age, but in almost every argument I can at least see where the grandparents are coming from. Actually, I can see myself doing the exact same thing in 60 years. Hell, I&rsquo;m already doing some of the crazy things they do.</p>

<p>One longstanding part of the grandparents&rsquo; routine is the morning pilgrimage to the Golden Arches. There they order the senior coffee, nothing else, and chat with friends or just each other for hours. The McDonalds senior coffee is a beautiful thing for them - $0.25 for unlimited refills of liquid tar&hellip;I mean gold. I&rsquo;m sure McDonalds established this deal as a way to get seniors in the door in hopes that they would order all of the egg McMuffins their feeble hearts could handle, but Mr. Frupid&rsquo;s grandparents have hacked that system masterfully. I should mention that McDonalds raised the price of the senior coffee a few years ago, and we still haven&rsquo;t heard the end of it.</p>

<p>McDonalds obviously isn&rsquo;t alone in offering discounted goods to seniors. It&rsquo;s pretty common practice in restaurants, although when I stop to think about it, I&rsquo;m not entirely sure why. The naive optimist in me thinks that the discounts are just a way for restaurants to thank the elderly for their lifetime of hard work. The realistic side of me, however, assumes that restaurants recognize that senior citizens are now living on fixed incomes and therefore more prudent with their pocketbooks. Offering a senior discount is a great way to make it look like going to that restaurant is a deal, so restaurants can pull in more customers with a negligible impact to their margins.</p>

<p>No matter the reason, seniors love a good deal. Any time an establishment is giving away cheap or free stuff, you&rsquo;ll always find old people there, even in young Seattle. Why do I know this? Because these establishments are filled with old people plus two - Mr. Frupid and me.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a bank near both of our offices that set out to be a neighborhood hang-out when it opened. It has tables, a few couches, and even a fake fireplace for ambience. But the best thing they have to offer is free made-to-order coffee, good coffee! To sweeten the deal, they also offer free cookies on Fridays (pun intended). All of these things are meant for anyone in the community, in theory. However, it is incredibly awkward to walk into an empty bank, make yourself a coffee, and then have a seat, particularly if you&rsquo;re not a customer. So no one does it, except old people and us.</p>

<p>I think normal people lose their shame/embarrassment filter when they hit old age. Fortunately, it seems Mr. Frupid and I were born without said filter, so we can take advantage of awkward perks for life! So, shame filter absent, we waltz right into this bank, make ourselves coffees and grab multiple cookies just about every Friday. It&rsquo;s actually become one of our most regular dates! The only other people we ever see enjoying the delicious bank coffee are clearly about 50 years older than us.</p>

<p>While this ritual of ours isn&rsquo;t exactly frupid, it is unusual, at least for people not accustomed to taking advantage of senior discounts. So, I encourage you, try ignoring that shame filter for a day and see what wonderful free while slightly awkward perks await!</p>
